This project implements a simple Face Detection system using Python. The system detects faces in images and videos using the OpenCV library and a pre-trained Haar Cascade classifier.

Features: 
Detects faces in real-time using a webcam.
Detects faces in static images.
Draws bounding boxes around detected faces.
Easy-to-use interface with basic code structure.

Requirements :
Make sure you have the following installed to run the project:

Python 3.x
OpenCV
NumPy

You can install the dependencies using the following command:
pip install opencv-python numpy

Acknowledgments :
The face detection model is based on Haar Cascade classifiers provided by OpenCV.
Special thanks to the OpenCV and Python community for documentation and support.
